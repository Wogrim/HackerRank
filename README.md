# HackerRank

My code from solving HackerRank problems.  There is a lot of boilerplate IO code provided by HackerRank; I have generally separated my code with comments but left that in for context.  See the problem links for additional context.  I don't know if you can see anything useful from it, but here's the link to my [HackerRank profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/Wogrim?hr_r=1).
